    <h1>Welcome to the secure-ish password manager website</h1>
    <h5>Hi, my name is supersmartgoldfish and I'm 11 years old.</h5>
    <h5>I built secure-ish password manager for fun and IT IS NOT SECURE.<br>I had and have no intention of this being used as an actual password manager so PLEASE dont use this to actually store your passwords,<br> but Do use it for fun and play around with the code, as it is completely opn source , written in python and very simple</h5>
    <h5>Currently there is only version 1.0.0 but i will hopefully continue working on it.<br> It is also only available for windows but i hope to improve that in the future</h5>
