  <h1>secure-ish password manager</h1>

  <p>Hey there! I'm <strong>supersmartgoldfish</strong>, an 11-year-old human (probably), and I built a totally untrustworthy password manager — just for fun!</p>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Important-ish:</strong><br>
    This app is called <code>secure-ish</code> because it's very much <em>not</em> secure.<br>
    It’s a Python project I made for learning, experimenting, and impressing exactly zero cybersecurity experts.<br>
    Please don’t use it for actual passwords unless you enjoy chaos.
  </div>

  <p>
    The app is open-source, written in <code>Python</code>, and designed for fun, not function.<br>
    It’s only available for Windows (for now), but I’m working on maybe kind of possibly improving that... eventually.
  </p>

  <div class="downloads">
    <a href="secure-ish.exe" download>
      <button>⬇️ Download v1.0.0 for Windows</button>
    </a>
    <a href="secure-ish.py" download>
      <button>📂 Python Source Code</button>
    </a>
  </div>

  <footer>
    <p>Made with love and <code>print()</code> statements</p>
    <p>Oh, yeah, by the way chrome doesn't let you download it unless you manually override it and windows won't let you run it unless you select more options, then run anyway</p>
    <p>Definitely not some sketchy malware ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
